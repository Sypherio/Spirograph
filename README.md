# Spirograph
Generate beautiful spirographs.

This is a project I started at HackRU in fall of 2014. It was my first time ever touching HTML, CSS or JavaScript and I wanted to put something together that would show a lot for the effort I put in.

This program create spirographs, which are geometric shapes generated by this concept:

A point orbits a static coordinate in circle, like the earth orbits the sun. 
Then, another point orbits this already-moving point, like the moon orbits the earth. 
This "moon", or third point draws its path to create beautiful shapes which are made 
unique by modifing variables like orbit speed, direction, and radius.

These are just some of the seemingly-infinite results you can get.
